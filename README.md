Generate Moore-neighborhood Cellular Automata with arbitrary rulesets.

Picks a random set of transition rules for each of the 2<sup>9</sup> = 512 different configurations of the 2-state Moore neighborhood (including central square). Each such configuration can lead to either a living or a dead cell in the next iteration, meaning that the space of possible cellular automata that can be generated by this method is of size 2<sup>2<sup>9</sup></sup> = 2<sup>512</sup> ~ 10<sup>154</sup>.

Many such rulesets are trivial or near-trivial, but judicious selection of Hamming density, as well as some patience, can produce fairly interesting results. For example:

This ruleset, ```803C05A8C80A540C923186984909A026C122468438198200008948180614C61A3A600457CC508032A048012080480892541844208801A10895B6800815D40848```, demonstrates multiple different types of ships, still-lifes and puffers, and even shows a rudimentary ability for moving patterns to shift still-lifes without destroying them (e.g. look near the bottom right near the end of the animation).
